Binary packages for some platforms are available from the
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tarray[Sourceforge download area].
See the link:build.html[build instructions] for other platforms.

To install the extension, extract the files from the distribution to any
directory that is included in your Tcl installation's `auto_path` variable.

Once installed, the extension can be loaded with the standard Tcl package
require command.
