    == Introduction

    The `tarray_ui` package implements some Tk widgets that useful when
    working with typed arrays.

    The package currently implements two widgets,
    ((^ ui_tableview tableview)) and ((^ ui_csvimport csvimport)).

    The `tableview` widget displays data from a typed array
    ((^ chap_table_ref table)). It is written with a view to conserve
    memory when displaying tables with a large amount of data. At
    the same time it provides several standard features without requiring
    any additional programming on part of the developer.
    
    The `csvimport` widget reads CSV data from a file into a
    table. It displays various options to the user to control
    of settings related to CSV parsing and preview the results
    before importing the data into a table.

    === Widget overview

    ==== The tableview widget

    The `tableview` widget displays data from a `tarray`
    ((^ chap_table_ref table)). 
    Based on Tim Baker's `treectrl` widget,
    it maintains `treectrl` features like drag and drop for resizing
    and repositioning table columns and also adds additional features
    like filtered views, visual keying of cells, tooltips
    and automatic scrollbars.
    
    The following call displays
    the contents of a variable `cities` containing a
    ((^ chap_table_ref table)) of geographical data.
} syntax {
    tarray::ui::tableview .top $cities -showfilter 1
    pack .cities -fill both -expand
} text {
    The corresponding table, sorted by name and filtered
    to only list cities in the eastern hemispere having a population
    of more than a million, is shown below.

    ((cmddef ui_tableview "tableview _WIDGET_ _TABLE_ ?_OPTIONS_?"))
    
    Creates a `tableview` widget that displays data from a
    ((^ chap_table_ref table)). It is written with a view to conserve
    memory when displaying tables with a large amount of data. At
    the same time it provides several standard features without requiring
    any additional programming on part of the developer.

    The widget is based on Tim Baker's `treectrl` widget which is
    available from http://tktreectrl.sf.net[SourceForge] and must
    be downloaded separately.

    _WIDGET_ should be the Tk window path for the widget. This is also
    the return value of the command. _TABLE_ should be a tarray
    table containing the data to be displayed. The supported options
    for the command are shown in ((^ tab_ui_tableview_opts)).

    |===
    |Option
    |Description

    |`-colattrs _COLUMNATTRS_`
    |Specifies various attributes for each column, such as title label. See
    ((^ sect_ui_tableview_colattrs)).

    |`-formatter _COMMANDPREFIX_`
    |Specifies a command prefix to be invoked to format data for display.
    See ((^ sect_ui_tableview_formatter)).

    |`-showfilter _BOOLEAN_`
    |If specified as `true`, the widget displays controls for filtering the
    data. See ((^ sect_ui_tableview_filters)).

    |`-visuals _VISUALSTATES_`
    |Allows definition of states that control the visual aspects of
    displayed data such as fonts and colors.
    See ((^ sect_ui_tableview_formatter)).

    |`-xscrolldelay _DELAYSPEC_`
    |Controls rate of horizontal scrolling when the dragging the horizontal
    scrollbar slider with the mouse button pressed. _DELAYSPEC_ is a list
    of one or two integers in milliseconds. The first is the delay after
    the initial scroll and the second, which defaults to the same value
    as the first, is the delay for subsequent scrolls.
    
    |`-yscrolldelay _DELAYSPEC_`
    |Similar to the `-xscrolldelay` option except that it applies to
    vertical scrolling.
    
    |===
}

text {
    ((===== sect_ui_tableview_colattrs "Column attributes"))

    Each display column in a `tableview` has attributes that are specified
    with the `-colattrs` option when the widget is created. The value passed
    with this option should be a dictionary keyed by the column name in the
    table. The corresponding value in the dictionary is itself a dictionary
    keyed by the attribute name. Defaults are used for missing column
    and attribute keys.

    Column attributes are shown in ((^ tab_ui_tableview_colattrs)).

    ((.Table tab_ui_tableview_colattrs "Tableview column attributes"))
    [options="header"]
    [cols="20,30,50"]
    |===
    |Attribute
    |Permitted values
    |Description

    |`Heading`
    |Any string
    |Specifies the column heading. If unspecified, defaults to the name
    of the column in the table being displayed.

    |`Justify`
    |`left`, `right`
    |Specifies whether the data in the column is left-justified or
    right-justified. If unspecified, justification depends on the
    data type of the table column. Numeric columns are right justified
    and others are left justified.
    
    |`Sortable`
    |Boolean
    |If true (default), clicking on the column header will sort the column,
    toggling between ascending and descending order. If false, clicking
    on the column heading will have no effect.

        elevation {Heading {Elevation (m)}}
    }
    pack .cities.tbl -fill both -expand 1
} text {
    Note that not every attribute has to be defined for every column
    and not every column needs to be listed (though we have listed all above).
}

text {
    ((===== sect_ui_tableview_formatter "Formatting data and visuals"))

    By default, the widget displays table data in its "`natural`"
    string representation. In some cases the application may need to
    format it differently, for example, displaying an integer in
    hexadecimal form. Moreover, some values may need to be visually
    distinguished, negative values displayed in red for instance.

    Both these needs are met through the use of the `-formatter` and
    `-visuals` options to the `tableview` widget.

    .Visual states

    A _visual_ defines a named visual state as a combination of font, foreground
    and background colors.
    These states can be applied to table rows or cells to visually
    distinguish them.

    There are 7 such states, `visual1`..`visual7`,
    and the settings for each can be defined through the `-visuals` option.
    The value supplied for this option should be a dictionary keyed by
    the name of the visual state. The value associated with each defined
    state is itself a dictionary with the (optional) visual attribute
    keys shown in ((^ tab_ui_tableview_visual_attrs)).

    ((.Table tab_ui_tableview_visual_attrs "Tableview visual attributes"))
    [options="header"]
    [cols="20,80"]
    |===
    |Attribute
    |Description

    |`-bg _COLOR_`
    |Alias for `-background`.
    
    |`-background _COLOR_`
    |Specifies the background color to associate with the visual state.
    _COLOR_ can be specified in any form accepted by Tk.
    
    |`-fg _COLOR_`
    |Alias for `-foreground`.
    
    |`-font _FONT_`
    |Specifies the Tk font.

    |`-foreground _COLOR_`
    |Specifies the foreground color to associate with the visual state.
    _COLOR_ can be specified in any form accepted by Tk.
    
    |=== 

    The order in which visual states are passed in the `-visuals` option
    is important. When multiple visual states are applied to a row
    or cell, the visual states that appear earlier take priority over
    those that appear later in the case where both states include the
    same attribute.
    
    Once the visual states have been defined, they can be applied to any
    row or individual cell through the formatter callback. This is
    described next.
}

text {
    .Formatting data

    If the default string representation of data or its visual display
    is not suitable, an application can provide a callback via the
    `-formatter` configuration option that will be used to convert
    the data into a suitable form for display.
    The value passed for this option
    should be a command prefix which will be invoked with
    two additional arguments. The first is the index of the row being
    formatted in the table that was passed to the widget. The second
    is a dictionary keyed by column names and containing the corresponding
    table cell values.

    The return value from the invocation should be a list of one or two
    elements. The first element should be in the same form
    as the second argument passed to the callback, i.e. a dictionary
    indexed by column names. The dictionary values will be used
    as the display strings for the corresponding columns.

    The second element is optional and if present, specifies the visual
    states to be assigned to the row or individual cell. This should be
    a dictionary keyed by the column name. The corresponding value should
    be a list of visual states to assign to the cell in that column and row.
    If more than one state is specified, defined attributes in states appearing
    later in the list override those attributed for states earlier in the list.
    The dictionary may also contain the empty string as a special key whose
    value is again a list of visual states. This will apply to all columns
    in the entire row.

    [NOTE]
    The visual states associated with a cell is the union of the states
    associated with the row containing the cell and the states directly
    applied to the cell. When two states define the same attribute, the
    one that takes effect depends on the order in which the visual states
    were listed in the `-visuals` option as discussed earlier.

    .Example

    The small sample script below demonstrates the use of `-visuals` and
    `-formatter`. The `format_city` callback formats the latitude and
    longitude values to two decimal places. Additionally, it highlights
    all tropical cities in red, and population values above a hundred
    thousand are shown with white text on a red background.
} uiscript {
    proc format_city {row_index row_values} {
        foreach col {latitude longitude} {
            dict set row_values $col [format %2.2f [dict get $row_values $col]]
        }
        set visuals {}
        set latitude [dict get $row_values latitude]
        if {$latitude < 23.5 && $latitude > -23.5} {
            dict set visuals "" visual2; # Set the visual for the entire row 
        } else {
            dict set visuals "" ""
        }
        if {[dict get $row_values population] > 100000} {
            dict set visuals population visual1; # Set the visual only for the population cell
        } else {
            dict set visuals population ""
        }
        return [list $row_values $visuals]
    }

    toplevel .cities
    tarray::ui::tableview .cities.tbl $cities -formatter format_city -visuals {
        visual1 {-bg red -fg white}
        visual2 {-fg red}
    }; # Note `visual1` which is applied to a column cell is listed before `visual2` so as to give it higher priority
    pack .cities.tbl -fill both -expand 1

    ((===== sect_ui_tableview_filters Filters))

    Filters are a mechanism that let the end-user restrict displayed data
    to table rows that match certain criteria. Filters are enabled
    by configuring the widget's `-showfilter` option as `true`.

    Enabling filters results in an additional header row being displayed under
    the heading for each column. Clicking in the filter header for a column
    will display an entry field where the user can type in an filter
    expression. Only those rows for which the cell for that column matches
    the expression will be displayed. When filters are defined for multiple
    columns, all have to match for a row to be displayed.

    The filter syntax is
} syntax {
    _CONDITION_ _VALUE_
} text {
    where _CONDITION_ is one of the conditions shown in
    ((^ tab_ui_tableview_filter_cond)) and _VALUE_ is the value to
    be compared against the column cell.

    ===== Sorting

    Clicking on a column header sorts the table based on the values in
    that column.
}

text {
    ===== Selection and clipboard
    
    The `tableview` widget implements bindings for selecting rows that
    follow the behaviour of the Tk `listbox` widget's extended select mode.
    See the documentation for `listbox` for details.

    The widget generates a `+<<ListboxSelect>>+` event when there is any
    change in the selection. The `%d` placeholder in any bound script
    is replaced with a list of two elements. The first is a list of
    row indices removed from the selection and the second
    a list of row indices added to the selection.

}

text {
    ===== Scrollbars

    The `tableview` widget has built-in horizontal and vertical
    scrollbars that appear as needed.  There is no need for
    applications to provide separate scrollbars.
}

text {
    ===== Keyboard bindings

    The `tableview` widget has the following keyboard bindings by default.
    
    [no-bullet]
    * `+<<Copy>>+` copies the currently selected rows to the clipboard. The rows
    are copied as text with tabs separating cells and newlines separating the
    rows. Usually bound to kbd:[Ctrl+C].
    * `+<<SelectAll>>+` selects all rows in the table.
    Usually bound to kbd:[Ctrl+a] or kbd:[Ctrl+/].
    * kbd:[Escape] clears the selection.
    * kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] move the selection by one row.
    If the kbd:[Shift] key
    is pressed, the selection is extended instead.
    * The kbd:[Next]/kbd:[PgDn] and kbd:[Prior]/kbd:[PgUp] move the display
    by a page. The selection is not affected.
    * The kbd:[Ctrl+Next]/kbd:[Ctrl+PgDn] and kbd:[Ctrl+Prior]/kbd:[Ctrl+PgUp]
    right or left by the width of the window.
    * kbd:[Home] and kbd:[End] keys scroll the table horizontally to
    the first and last columns respectively.
    * kbd:[Ctrl+Home] and kbd:[Ctrl+End] move the display to the top
    and bottom of the table respectively, setting the selection in the process.
    If the kbd:[Shift] key is simultaneously pressed, the selection is extended.
}

text {
    ===== Mouse bindings

    The `tableview` widget has the following mouse bindings by default.
    
    [no-bullet]
    * `+<Button-1>+` will set the selection to the row under the mouse.
    * If the kbd:[Ctrl] key is pressed in conjunction,
    the row under the mouse is added
    to the selection if not already present, or removed if it is.
    * If the
    kbd:[Shift] key is pressed in conjunction, the selection is extended
    to include all rows between the selection anchor and the row under
    the mouse.
    * Dragging with `+<Button-1>+` pressed extends the selection. If the mouse
    is moved out of the window, contents are scrolled if necessary.
    * Double clicking `+<Button-1>+` results in the window generating
    the `+<<ItemDoubleClick>>+` virtual event.
    * Clicking `+<Button-3>+` results in the window generating
    the `+<<ItemRightClick>>+` virtual event.

    When the virtual events `+<<ItemDoubleClick>>+` and
    `+<<ItemRightClick>>+` are generated,
    the `%d` substitution placeholder in the script bound to these
    events will be replaced with a dictionary with the keys
    `Row` and `Column` containing the row index and column name
    of the table cell. The dictionary may contain additional keys
    which should be ignored for future compatibility.
}

text {
    ===== Tooltips

    Data that is too long to fit within a column cell width is shown truncated
    with ellipsis. Hovering over the cell will pop up a tooltip containing
    the full data.
}
