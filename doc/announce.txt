= Overview

As is true for scripting languages in general, Tcl incurs significant
overhead in terms of memory as well as performance when operating on
large amounts of data. The set of packages described here provide
a more performant and convenient means of working with large data
sets. The three packages are

* `tarray` -- implements the core column and table data types and
parallelized operations on data sets
* `xtal` -- provides succint, convenient syntax for working with data sets
* `tarray_ui` -- contains Tk widgets that are useful for display
and user interaction

The packages come with comprehensive documentation, an extensive test
suite and are covered by a liberal open source license.
