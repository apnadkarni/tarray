= Overview

As is true for scripting languages in general, Tcl incurs significant
overhead in terms of memory as well as performance when operating on
large amounts of data. The set of packages described here provide
a more performant and convenient means of working with large data
sets. The three packages are

* `tarray` -- implements the core column and table data types and
parallelized operations on data sets
* `xtal` -- provides succint, convenient syntax for working with
tables and columns as well as Tcl lists and dicts
* `tarray_ui` -- Tk widgets that are useful when working with tables
and columns

The packages come with comprehensive documentation, an extensive test
suite containing almost 30,000 tests and are covered
by a liberal open source license.

= Downloads

The Downloads area contains the following files:

* `tarray-bin-VERSION.zip` and `xtal-bin-VERSION.zip contain Windows binaries
of `tarray` and `xtal` for both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

* `tarray-VERSION.tar.gz and xtal-VERSION.tar.gz contain TEA-based
source distributions of `tarray` and `xtal`  for Unix platforms.

* `tarray_ui-VERSION.tar.gz` and `tarray_ui-VERSION.zip` contain the
`tarray_ui` pure Tcl package.

The directory also contains optional third-party packages that are
used to implement the widgets in the `tarray_ui` package:

* `rbc-bin-VERSION (x86).zip` and `rbc-bin-VERSION (x64).zip`
contain 32- and 64-bit binaries of the `RBC` package used by `tarray_ui`
to display charts. The rbc-VERSION.tar.gz contains the TEA based
source distribution suitable for compiling on Unix platforms.
These are built from a fork of the original RBC package with
some fixes for Windows and a stubs interface for more efficient
integration with `tarray`.

* `tktreectrl-bin-VERSION (x86).zip` and `tktreectrl-bin-VERSION (x64).zip`
contain 32- and 64-bit binaries of the `tktreectrl` package used by `tarray_ui`
to display tables. The tktreectrl-VERSION.tar.gz contains the TEA based
source distribution suitable for compiling on Unix platforms.
These are built from a fork of the original tktreectrl package with
some performance fixes.
